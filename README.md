Project submitssion for 2022 ShowCode Hackathon

For this hackathon I chose to submit a project that would fulfill the challenge set
by OpenBet. Their theme for this year was, "Creating a safer betting experience". They posed
the challenge was to simulate one or more safer gambling tools. These tools could be based on
current key controls or a new idea.

What is a safer betting experiance?
-A safer betting experiance creates a mutually safe interaction between gamers (gamblers) and hosts. It protects the gamers from their own potential financial self-destruction and from potential iligitimate gaming hosts.

What are some of the current key player facing controls?
-Player Limits
• These are player controled setting that can limit things like deposit amounts, spending
and time playing.
-Player Exclusions
• These player or host set controls on a playtime. This can include shorter blocks on platime in the form of self-exclusion and breaks or longer exclusion periods that reqiure more effort to lift.
-Access to help
• Links in this section should provide users with information on resources, help from the game operater, or limits that block targeted margeting to highly active gamblers.
-Reality Checks
• These breif interuptions in playtime that gives the players an opportunity to do a self-check on their current state. It also offers the player the oppertunity to look into other safe gambling tools.

What have I found? - A brief look at how psychology and gambling interact with each other lead me to three posible areas, where technology could be used to counter the negative hold that gambling addictions have on gamers. 1) The theory of "losses disguised as wins". The ability for gamers to bet on multiple lines per spin leads to warped sense of winning. Even though a bet on multiple lines result in a net reward less that the original bet, it is still percieved as a win dispite it being a lose overall. 2) The lights and sounds create an overall experiance that promotes gambling. There is also the belief that the lights and sounds can encoureage longer and faster playtimes in gamers. 3) Mobile and online gaming allow gamers the ability to play from the comfort of their home, without destraction or input that my counter their desision to continue playing.

What is my goal?
-I would like to purpose implementing two new tools that will fall under two of the umbrellas of the current key player facing controls. - New setting under the Reality Checks umbrella
• To counter the affects of issues one and three listed above I would like to suggest a voice alert that highlights the disparities in wins and loses then ask the gamer if they would like to set player limits or continue playing. Allowing the gamer to clearly see how many times they have lost (presenting them with information on lines lost), gives them a chance to eveluate the situation better in a more transparent form. Since we regulary encounter silent pop-ups while using the internet a voice alert added to the pop-up may have a stronger effect on grabbing the gamer's attention, and envock a true self-reflection over the reality check questions. - New setting under the Player Limits umbrella
• To counter the affects of issue 2, stated above, I would like to suggest a setting that triggers a change in the lights, sounds and colors of the game interface. Instead of presenting gamers with the positive sounds assosiated with wins, there will be an imphasis on loses and negative or unpleasent sounds will be played. During this time the players will also no longer see light or vibrent colors, but instead the game should be set to a grey or bland color scheme.
