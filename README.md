Project submitssion for 2022 ShowCode Hackathon

For this hackathon, I chose to submit a project that would fulfill the challenge set
by OpenBet. Their theme for this year was, "Creating a safer betting experience". They posed
the challenge to simulate one or more, safer gambling tools. These tools could be based on
current key controls or a new idea.

What is a safer betting experience?
-A safer betting experience creates a mutually safe interaction between gamers (gamblers) and hosts. It protects the gamers from their potential financial self-destruction and potential illegitimate gaming hosts.

What are some of the current key player-facing controls?
-Player Limits
• These are player-controlled settings that can limit things like deposit amounts, spending
and time playing.
-Player Exclusions
• These players or hosts set controls on a playtime. This can include shorter blocks on playtime in the form of self-exclusion and breaks or longer exclusion periods that require more effort to lift.
-Access to help
• Links in this section should provide users with information on resources, help from the game operator, or limits that block targeted marketing to highly active gamblers.
-Reality Checks
• These brief interruptions in playtime allow the players to do a self-check on their current state. It also offers the player the opportunity to look into other safe gambling tools.

What have I found? - A brief look at how psychology and gambling interact with each other led me to three possible areas, where technology could be used to counter the negative hold that gambling addictions have on gamers. 1) The theory of "losses disguised as wins". The ability for gamers to bet on multiple lines per spin leads to a warped sense of winning. Even though a bet on multiple lines results in a net reward less than the original bet, it is still perceived as a win despite it being a loss overall. 2) The lights and sounds create an overall experience that promotes gambling. There is also the belief that the lights and sounds can encourage longer and faster playtimes in gamers. 3) Mobile and online gaming allow gamers the ability to play from the comfort of their home, without distractions or input that may counter their decision to continue playing.

What is my goal?
-I would like to purpose implementing two new tools that will fall under two of the umbrellas of the current key player-facing controls. - New setting under the Reality Checks umbrella
• To counter the effects of issues one and three listed above I would like to suggest a voice alert that highlights the disparities in wins and loses then ask the gamer if they would like to set player limits or continue playing. Allowing the gamer to see how many times they have lost (presenting them with information on lines lost), gives them a chance to evaluate the situation better in a more transparent form. Since we regularly encounter silent pop-ups while using the internet a voice alert added to the pop-up may have a stronger effect on grabbing the gamer's attention, and invoke a true self-reflection over the reality check questions. - New setting under the Player Limits umbrella
• To counter the effects of issue 2, stated above, I would like to suggest a setting that triggers a change in the lights, sounds, and colors of the game interface. Instead of presenting gamers with the positive sounds associated with wins, there will be an emphasis on losses and negative or unpleasant sounds will be played. During this time the players will also no longer see light or vibrant colors, but instead, the game should be set to a grey or bland color scheme.
